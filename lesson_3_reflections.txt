When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Multiple users. Access from a different PC. Further backup in case access to local is restricted.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Efficiency. We might be changing a lot and therefore not need Git to stay up to date with our remote repository. We can then
  pull all our changes when we want to.
