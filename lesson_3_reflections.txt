When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  Multiple users. Access from a different PC. Further backup in case access to
  local is restricted.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Efficiency. We might be changing a lot and therefore not need Git to stay
  up to date with our remote repository. We can then pull all our changes when
  we want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

  Branches we would use locally. All we want is to create a new area to commit
  changes which has is different to our master branch but still contains all
  commits.

  Clone we could use locally (though it would be easier to use a branch), and
  through GitHub. We cloned the 'recipes' repository earlier to have that
  repository on our machine and not just on GitHub.

  Forking is the process of 'cloning' someone else's repository. You are
  basically cloning a repository, it just gets stored on GitHub servers and
  not locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  To see who last made changes.
